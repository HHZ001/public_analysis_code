These scripts parse and analyse individual behavioral data extracted from `.xpd` files generated by the protocols _mtt_ and _self_ protocols, `.mat` files generated by the _tom_ protocol and `.dat` files generated by the _enumeration_ protocol.

These protocols can be found in the repository on GitHub dedicated to the IBC behavioral protocols: https://github.com/hbp-brain-charting/public_protocols
